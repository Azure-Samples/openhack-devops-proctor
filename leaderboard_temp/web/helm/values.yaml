 # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
 # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
 # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
 # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
