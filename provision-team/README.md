## Pre-requisites

The required pre-requisites for installing a team environment are installed as part of proctor VM Setup.  The [setup script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/openhack-devops-proctor/master/provision-vm/proctorVMSetup.sh) lists all pre-reqs along with required versions.

## Usage

    `nohup ./setup.sh -i <subscriptionId> -l <resourceGroupLocation> -n <teamName> -e <teamNumber> `

- SubscriptionId - id of the subscription to deploy the team infrastructure to
- resourceGroupLocation - Azure region to deploy to.  **_Must be a region that supports ACR, AKS, and KeyVault._**
- teamName - name of the team.  This value is used for the base name of all of the resources provisioned in Azure.  **_Must be all lowercase alphanumeric characters_**
- teamNumber (optional) - specific number for a team to provision.  If this is not specified, a random (3 character + 1 number) will be auto-generated.
